## Introduction

This project addresses the challenge of uneven load distribution within datacenters in a federated cloud environment. The implementation is carried out using the CloudAnalyst simulation toolkit.

## Existing Results

The report presents two key test cases that compare the modified throttled algorithm (intra-balancer) against traditional algorithms such as Round-Robin and ESCE.

## Implementation

The implementation was developed using the CloudAnalyst simulation toolkit. Key steps included:

1. **Environment Setup**  
   - Installing Java SDKs and a Java IDE  
   - Download using belwo command and import the CloudAnalyst project
     ```
     git
     ```
     
2. **Algorithm Adaptation**
